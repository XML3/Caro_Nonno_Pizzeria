Ingredients
2 cups bread flour (about 10 ounces), plus some for dusting
1 teaspoon table salt
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil plus more for topping
3/4 cup bottled water warmed to 100 deg F
Plastic wrap
¾ cups tomato puree/passata
½ teaspoon dried Parsley
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon sugar
8 ounces mozzarella cheese hand grated
10 basil leaves
add red bell peppers (optional)


Instructions
In your stand mixer or large bowl, combine water, yeast, sugar, and one cup of flour. Gently combine and let stand for 3 minutes.
Following the rest period, begin to mix (use the hook attachment on your stand mixer) on low. Gently pour in remaining flour, salt, and oil. Let mix for 5 minutes on medium low speed (scraping the bowl as needed to keep the dough in the bowl).
Once mixed, form into ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in the fridge for 2 days, punching down after the first day.
Once risen, remove dough from fridge 2 hours before cooking.
Prepare sauce by combining the tomato puree, dried herbs, salt, and sugar.
Preheat oven to 450 deg F, and place your pizza stone in the middle of the oven. Place dough ball on floured surface, and roll out into a 14” circle. Transfer to your favorite pizza stone, top with the sauce, then cheese (leaving a ½” lip around the edge).
Traditional: Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden and puffy.
